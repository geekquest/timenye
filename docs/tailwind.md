"""
Runs the Tailwind development server for the Django project using the django-tailwind package.

Usage:
    python manage.py tailwind start

This command starts the Tailwind CSS build process in watch mode, allowing for automatic recompilation of CSS files when changes are made to your Tailwind source files. It is typically used during development to ensure that your styles are updated in real-time.

Prerequisites:
- Ensure that the django-tailwind package is installed and properly configured in your Django project.


Steps for contributors:
1. Navigate to your Django project root directory.
2. Run `python manage.py tailwind start` in your terminal.
3. Keep this process running in a separate terminal window while developing to automatically rebuild Tailwind CSS assets.

For more information, refer to the django-tailwind documentation: https://django-tailwind.readthedocs.io/
